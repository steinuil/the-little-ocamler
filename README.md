# The Little OCamler
Most of the code examples from [The Little MLer](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTML/index.html), a wonderful book from the "Little `X`er" series, in **OCaml** and **ReasonML**.

I thought other people who might have had the same idea as me might find it useful to have something to cross-reference, in case they get stuck because of some syntax idiosyncrasy in either SML or OCaml/ReasonML.

Do not just copy-paste this code into the REPL. Type it yourself, and only consult this if you have trouble with the syntax.

This is just a translation of the SML examples to OCaml, to the best of my efforts. Just don't expect idiomatic code or anything.

## But why?
While I am sure SML is a great language, when I started reading *The Little MLer* I only had the OCaml compiler on my computer.

Because I am a lazy person, I decided to take this as an opportunity to learn OCaml too.

## Now with ReasonML examples
Thanks to @hzamir, a translation to ReasonML syntax has been added under the `reasonml/` directory.

## Now with ReasonML/Bucklescript examples
A translation to ReasonML to JS compilations with Bucklescript has been added under the `reasonbs/` directory.

To run `npm install` then `npm start`.
